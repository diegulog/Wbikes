## Implementation

The app has five view control scenes:

- **SelectCityController**: shows the user the available cities ordered by country, when selecting a city it is saved in UserDefaults

- **MapController**: shows on the map the annotations with the different stops downloaded from the API http://api.citybik.es/v2/, to show the information of each station a custom BottomSheetView has been implemented that is show with an animation when touching the annotation

- **SearchController**: Allows users to see the stations in list mode and search for the stop using UISearchBar, this controller implements NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate to observe any data changes.

- **FavoritesController**: Allows users to view favorite stations in list mode and delete stations by tapping the edit button. NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate is also implemented to handle any data changes.

- **InfoController**: Shows relevant information of the application and allows the user to change cities.


The application uses CoreData to store Cities and their stations. All API calls are executed in background and updated data is stored in each query using CoreData.
